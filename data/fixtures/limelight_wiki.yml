#      The interface is based around the Home screen, a graphical list of
#      available applications. iPhone apps normally run one at a time (although
#      most functionality is still available when making a call). The home
#      screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button, closing the open
#      application in the process.[39] By default, the Home screen contains the
#      following icons: Text (SMS messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube,
#      Stocks, Maps (Google Maps), Weather, Clock, Calculator, Notes, Settings,
#      iTunes (store), and App Store. Four other applications, docked at the
#      base of the screen, delineate the iPhone's main purposes: Phone, Mail,
#      Safari (Internet), and iPod (music).[40] On January 15, 2008, Apple
#      released software update 1.1.3 which allowed users create "Web Clips,"
#      icons on the home screen that resemble apps that open a user-defined page
#      in Safari. Since that update, users have been allowed to rearrange icons
#      and place them on other adjacent home screens (up to nine), which can be
#      accessed by a horizontal swipe.[41] Users can also add and remove icons
#      from the dock, which does not change with the home screen. Each home
#      screen holds up to sixteen icons and the dock holds up to four.
